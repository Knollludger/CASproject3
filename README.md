# CASproject3
This project was done by Sean Timm and Matthew Timm, and was done to solve the separator problem in 1D and 2D. For more information, check out the PDF located in the repository.


To run the 1D code, just run CA1DGen.py. To run the 2D code display, run CA2DGen.py. To run the genetic algorithm for 2D, uncomment the main function and run again.

To run the HTML/Javascript visualizer, head into the /visualizer directory and use yarn install and yarn start. Be warned, it is not production code by any means!
